## LaunchPad but on an FPGA
##### But it's more like a music box/piano hybrid now

**Nov.20 Updates**

We have realized that it is not possible to recreate sounds through the fpga akin to the sounds we hear in everyday reality. This is because the sounds in reality have soundwaves that consist of many upon many different sound waves of varying amplitudes and frequencies superimposed on top of one another. We believe this is not a feasible creation through the current means of generating square waves. Instead, we have looked towards 8-bit music, also known as chiptune. We are looking towards recreating different sounds through square waves, pules waves, and possibly saw waves that can imitate sounds in real life instead of actually taking a sound smaple from real life and "recreating" it through 8-bit in the fpga.

**Nov.24 Updates**

- Flat Wave must be used to be play any sort of chord
- Either program entire song with all chords, or none at all, they may seem jarring
- Notes over the second octave sound bad (Starting with C6)
- Flats and Sharps sometimes sound out of place
- Flat_Wave (undampened square waves) take MUCH LESS TIME to compile than Square_Wave (dampened square waves) and the two do not sound much different (About 2.5 mins versus near 8 mins)
