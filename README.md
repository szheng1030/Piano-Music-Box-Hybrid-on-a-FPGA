#launchpad_but_on_a_fpga

Documentation:

We have realized that it is not possible to recreate sounds through the fpga akin to the sounds we hear in everyday reality. This is because the sounds in reality have soundwaves that consist of many upon many different sound waves of varying amplitudes and frequencies superimposed on top of one another. We believe this is not a feasible creation through the current means of generating square waves. Instead, we have looked towards 8-bit music, also known as chiptune. We are looking towards recreating different sounds through square waves, pules waves, and possibly saw waves that can imitate sounds in real life instead of actually taking a sound smaple from real life and "recreating" it through 8-bit in the fpga.
